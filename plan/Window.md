This code sets up the basic interactive desktop environment you described.

**Key Features Implemented:**

1.  **Toolbar & Plus Button:** A toolbar at the top with a "+" icon button.
2.  **App Menu:** Clicking the "+" shows/hides a dropdown listing the `availableApps` (defined in the JS) with icons and names. Clicking an app creates its window.
3.  **Window Creation:** Uses an HTML `<template>` to efficiently create new window elements.
4.  **Draggable Windows:** Click and drag the title bar to move windows.
5.  **Resizable Windows:** Click and drag the bottom-right handle to resize windows.
6.  **Bring to Front:** Clicking anywhere on a window brings it to the top of the stack (`z-index`) and applies an `active` class (useful for further styling).
7.  **IDs:** Each window instance gets a unique ID (`window-appid-timestamp`), and the original app ID (`notepad`, `gallery`, etc.) is stored in its `dataset`.
8.  **Title Bar:** Displays the app name initially. A `setWindowTitle(windowId, newTitle)` function is provided so you can change it later based on application logic.
9.  **Styling:** Uses Tailwind CSS for a clean look, including rounded corners and shadows. Lucide icons are used via a web font.
10. **Basic Structure:** Provides a `#window-area` where windows live and are positioned absolutely.

**Next Steps & Potential Improvements:**

* **Window Content:** The `.content-area` is currently just placeholder text. You would need to populate this with the actual UI/content for each "application".
* **Window Controls:** Only a close button is implemented. You could add minimize and maximize functionality.
* **State Management:** For more complex apps, you'd need a way to manage the state within each window.
* **Boundary Detection:** Prevent windows from being dragged completely off-screen.
* **Persistence:** Save window positions and states if needed (e.g., using `localStorage`).
* **Error Handling:** Add more robust checks.
* **Accessibility:** Improve focus management and add ARIA attributes.

This should give you a solid foundation to build upon! You can now start filling the `.content-area` of the windows with the actual components or interfaces for your different "apps".
